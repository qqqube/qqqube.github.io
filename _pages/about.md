Hello, my name is Spencer! I am currently a Ph.D. student at the National University of Singapore ([NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/)) advised by [Prof. Bryan Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/). My research primarily focuses on large language models.


Previously, I spent time as a visiting researcher at Stony Brook University (advised by [Prof. Ting Wang](https://alps-lab.github.io/)) and Tsinghua University (supervised by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/)). I also had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Junfeng Yang](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/) and [Prof. Asaf Cidon](https://www.asafcidon.com/) while earning my Master's.

I received my Bachelor’s degrees from UC Berkeley and have an M.S. from Columbia University.
